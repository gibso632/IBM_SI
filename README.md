# Individual-Based Model for Sky Islands

This repository holds files and code for creating an individual-based model for various species throughout the Madrean Archipelago

A weighted raster was used to determine areas where species would be move towards or not be able to leave. An accuracy analysis will be performed on the model by studying historic changes in population dynamics due to cooling and warming periods.
